## Assumptions
- Users have an accessible HPC at your work
- Data are stored in distributed file systems (usually incorporated into the HPC system)


## Basic workflow

### Practice for minimizing errors
- Consider using `try()` or `tryCatch()` not to a tiny error will halt all the work without any results 
    - Especially with the higher-level functions

### Raster-Vector overlay
- Make `sp_index_grid()` to get padded grid objects
- Convert sf/SpatVector objects into `terra::ext()` compatible named numeric vector
    - For example: `c(xmin=0, ymin=0, xmax=10, ymax=10)`
- Make list objects with: 
    - An extent vector in each element
    - Preprocessed vector objects with respect to each extent vector in the first list
    - Preferably all lists are named 
- Write a `future.apply` script running through the extent list object
- Run a small amount of data to estimate the total computational demand
- Submit a job with a proper amount of computational assets
